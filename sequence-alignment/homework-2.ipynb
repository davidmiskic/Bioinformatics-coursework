    "# Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the homework, you will conduct a phylogenetic analysis of a handful of coronaviruses. You will look at the similarity between the DNA sequences of these viruses to determine how closely related they are to one another. This might give us some insight into how these viruses might have evolved through time, or from which species SARS-CoV-2 jumped to us, humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a phylogenetic tree in two steps. First, we will calculate the distances between each pair of viral genomes. We can't just compare them directly, we have to align them first. So we will run global alignment to get an optimal alignment between each pair of viral genomes. Then, we will calculate the distance between these alignments using Hamming distance. This just checks the number of symbols in the two sequences which do not match. Having calculated all pairwise distances, we can build a dendrogram, which will serve as our phylogenetic tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on runtime:** To build a phylogenetic tree, you will need to calculate all pairwise distances between several coronavirus genomes. As you have learned in lectures, computing an alignment between two sequences of length $N$ and $M$ requires forming and calculating a table of $N \\cdot M$ entries. This is fine for small sequences, but genomes, even short ones like viral genomes, are generally too long for this. For this reason, we will not calculate pairwise alignments between complete viral genomes in our analysis, but we will focus on the spike protein sequence only. The spike protein is one of the most important parts of any virus, as it is the one that grants the virus entry to host cells. Also, doing so will reduce the sequence lengths from ~30k to around 1.3k, which is much more manageable. Even so, do your best to write fast, efficient Python code, as you will spend a long time waiting for your programs to complete otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speeding things up**: On my laptop, each `global_alignment` call on 1.3k long protein sequences takes around 30 seconds. We have to calculate 210 comparisons, which takes roughly two hours. For those of you who want to speed things up and play around with several parameter settings, you can take advantage of *numba*. *numba* is a Python JIT library, which compiles your code and makes it run faster. We will make *numba* available in the grading environment for this homework. This is not a requirement or even a recommendation, because *numba* can be a pain to work with. However, you are welcome to take advantage of this if you so wish."

Note that this distance is different from the global alignment score produced by `global_alignment`! Once you have calculated all pairwise distances, plot the dendrogram. Apply what you learned about hierarchical clustering in other machine learning courses to get as nice a dendrogram as possible. If you have not taken any machine learning courses, the recommendation is to not use *single linkage*. Save the resulting dendrogram into `problem2.png`. Are the results surprising?
